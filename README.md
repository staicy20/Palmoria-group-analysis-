# Palmoria Group HR Gender & Salary Analysis (Power BI)

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the HR dataset of Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company in Nigeria, using Power BI. The objective is to uncover gender-related inequalities, investigate pay structure compliance, and support management decision-making through a visually-driven dashboard.

##  Objectives
- Analyze gender distribution across regions and departments
- Investigate performance ratings by gender
- Identify gender pay gaps across departments and regions
- Check compliance with the new regulation requiring a $90,000 minimum salary
- Present findings in an interactive Power BI dashboard

## Data Cleaning Steps
- Replaced missing gender values with "Undisclosed"
- Removed employees with no salary (no longer with the company)
- Filtered out "NULL" departments

##  Key Visuals in Dashboard
- Pie chart: Overall gender distribution
- Stacked column chart: Gender by Region and Department
- Bar chart: Average rating by Gender
- Matrix: Average salary by gender across departments
- Histogram: Salary band distribution in $10,000 increments
- Stacked column chart: Salary band by Region
- KPI Cards: Total Employees, % Female, % Below $90,000

## Recommendations
